# Arduino_Code_Examples

This repo is filled with exemples of code for different sensors, modules, projects, etc.
These code have been testing with arduino Unos and Mega. There is a change I made mistakes and that the codes do not work... If that's the case, you can open an issue and I'll look into it.

If you cannot find a code suitable for your sensor, create an issue and I'll make a code whenever I have the time!

Suggestions are always appreciated!
